**The sinking of the Titanic**<br>
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is undoubtedly one of the greatest disasters to happen in the sea.<br>
The ship sunk on its maiden voyage(not the best debut in fairness)<br>
**Our challenge**<br>
Kaggle has given us the dataset that contains the list of passengers that have survived the disaster<br>
But there's a catch<br>
They have removed the final few values so we don't know who survived out the 418(around about) values.<br>
Luckily we have the remaining other values to help us<br>
**The objective**
Create a Machine learning model to predict who survived and who didn't from the test data(the 418 something values I mentioned)
